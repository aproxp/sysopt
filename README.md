# Systems Optimisation course

Files contain exercises and playground for various system optimisation methods.

## Exercise 1 - Simulated annealing

Provided `simanneal.py` script will, by default, run the simulated annealing algorithm on the
`large.xml` task set and put the solution under `solutions/sol.xml`. Additionally, `solutions/sol.svg`
plot visualises the average laxity of the solution after each iteration.

No user interface is provided. The problem set can be changed by modifying the `DATA_IN` constant
in the script.
